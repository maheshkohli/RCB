ndia were eventually bowled out for 189, gaining a slender lead of 30 runs. Harmer took 4 and Jansen had three to his name - if the game has swung marginally in favour of India, it's because of Jadeja's four-wicket burst which has crippled South Africa. Temba Bavuma has batted fluently and they'll hope that he stretches this lead past the 100-run mark. The wicket has been difficult, but a few shots from the visitors were poor. Can India slice through the remaining wickets and chase down the target? Day 3 should be the last day of this Test and it's still on a knife-edge. India are probably ahead by a 60-40 margin, but you can't rule out a South African comeback. We'll be back tomorrow at 9:30 am for all the action. For now, cheers and bye..
